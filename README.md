#### SORTING ALGORITHMS AND BIG O IN C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Sorting algorithms is a method that involves the rearrangement of elements in a list such as names to be arranged in an alphabetical order. Examples of sorting algorithms are merge sort, quick sort and bubble sort.Big O defines the efficiency and time complexity of an algorithm.An example is  O(n), meaning the runtime grows linearly with the input size. 

##### The requirements
- The allowed editors are emacs , vi and vim
- The files should end with a new line
- There should be a README.md file at the root of folder
- Not allowed to use global variables
- Not allowed to use the standard library unless asked to
- Prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
- List/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

##### The Tasks
- Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
- Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
